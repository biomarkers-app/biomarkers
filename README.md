### Biomarkers

This application will help you make sense of your lab results when you donate blood or have your health checked with easy to read cards for each biomarker coupled with clear, concise, charts showing the optimal range for each result. This app is work in progress. Please contact me at gmettifogo@gmail.com if interested in helping out.

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS. THE DEPLOYED APPLICATION IS NOT AT ALL COMPLETE, HAS NOT YET BEEN RELEASED, SOME PAGES MAY BE COMPLETE, SOME HALF DONE, SOME JUST DRAFTS. MOST OF THE CONTENTS ARE JUST PLACEHOLDERS FOR NOW. WE ARE LOOKING FOR COLLABORATORS, ESPECIALLY CONTENT EDITORS.
