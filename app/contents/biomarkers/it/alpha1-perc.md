Alpha globulins are proteins synthesized in the liver and circulating in the blood, which we can divide into two groups:

Alpha globulins 1
- Alpha1-antitrypsin
- Alpha1-antichimotrypsin
- Alpha1-acid glycoprotein
- Amyloid serum A
- Alf 1-lipoprotein

Alpha globulins 2
- Haptoglobin
- Higher urinary proteins
- Alpha2-macroglobulin
- Ceruloplasmin
- thyroid hormone binding globulin - TBG
- Alpha2-antiplasmin
- Protein C
- Alpha2-lipoprotein
- Angiotensinogen

From a laboratory point of view, they are differentiated from other proteins present in the blood through a process called electrophoresis, a technique that allows separation based on the physical characteristics of the molecules such as charge (positive or negative), size and shape.

The concentration values ​​of alpha globulins in the blood increase for example in the presence of inflammation.

The causes of altered values ​​are numerous and their interpretation must always be carried out in a broader framework, considering the symptoms complained of by the patient and the other results of blood tests, also because small shifts from normal values ​​could be insignificant.

From a very general point of view, it is possible to state that an increase in the circulating quantities of alpha-1 proteins is often connected to the presence of: inflammation, tumor, chronic inflammatory disease (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, ...).

A significant decrease is generally due to an alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, a hereditary condition in which the lack of the enzyme of the same name causes lung and liver disorders.
