Alpha globulins are proteins synthesized in the liver and circulating in the blood, which we can divide into two groups:

Alpha globulins 1
- Alpha1-antitrypsin
- Alpha1-antichimotrypsin
- Alpha1-acid glycoprotein
- Amyloid serum A
- Alf 1-lipoprotein

Alpha globulins 2
- Haptoglobin
- Higher urinary proteins
- Alpha2-macroglobulin
- Ceruloplasmin
- thyroid hormone binding globulin - TBG
- Alpha2-antiplasmin
- Protein C
- Alpha2-lipoprotein
- Angiotensinogen

From a laboratory point of view, they are differentiated from other proteins present in the blood through a process called electrophoresis, a technique that allows separation based on the physical characteristics of the molecules such as charge (positive or negative), size and shape.

The concentration values of alpha globulins in the blood increase for example in the presence of inflammation.

The causes of altered values are numerous and their interpretation must always be carried out in a broader framework, considering the symptoms complained of by the patient and the other results of blood tests, also because small shifts from normal values ​​could be insignificant.

An increase in the quantities of alpha-2 is usually linked to severe inflammation (acute or chronic) and other more or less serious conditions, such as:
- hyperthyroidism
- adrenal insufficiency
- advanced diabetes mellitus
- nephrotic syndrome

A decrease in alpha-2 to hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells), megaloblastic anemia (typically from vitamin B12 and / or folate deficiency), liver disease.
