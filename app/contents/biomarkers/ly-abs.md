Lymphocytes are white blood cells and part of the immune system, a complex integrated network of cells, tissues and biological mechanisms aimed at the body's defense.

They are produced in the bone marrow and can be classified into two broad categories based on the tissue where their final maturation occurs: B lymphocytes (maturation in the bone marrow), T lymphocytes (maturation in the thymus).

In light of their function, it is therefore entirely predictable to observe temporary increases in their presence in the blood, but the extent and duration of these changes can help the doctor in the various diagnostic processes.

The exam is generally part of the tests required when performing the blood count.

A high value of lymphocytes (lymphocytosis) is usually detected following tests required for symptoms that have already emerged, while an unexpected or accidental discovery is rare; usually we speak of lymphocytosis when the result exceeds 4,000 per microliter, although the number can greatly increase, especially in children and infants.

Lymphocytosis is often indicative of viral infections (such as mononucleosis), but can also be seen in cases of intracellular bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis.
