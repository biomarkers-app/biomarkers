A glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a blood test that checks how well your kidneys are working. Your kidneys have tiny filters called glomeruli. These filters help remove waste and excess fluid from the blood. A GFR test estimates how much blood passes through these filters each minute.

A GFR can be measured directly, but it is a complicated test, requiring specialized providers. So GFR is most often estimated using a test called an estimated GFR or eGFR. To get an estimate, your provider will use a method known as a GFR calculator. A GFR calculator is a type of mathematical formula that estimates the rate of filtration. It does this by comparing the results of a blood test that measures creatinine, a waste product filtered by the kidneys, with other information about you. 

This information includes some or all of the following: the results of a blood test that measures creatinine, a waste product filtered by the kidneys, age, weight, height, gender, race. The eGFR is a simple test that can provide very accurate results.
