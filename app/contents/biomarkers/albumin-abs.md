Albumin is the most abundant protein in the blood. It keeps fluid from leaking out of blood vessels; nourishes tissues; and transports hormones, vitamins, drugs, enzymes, and ions like calcium throughout the body.

Albumin is made in the liver and is extremely sensitive to liver damage. The concentration of albumin drops when the liver is damaged, when a person is malnourished, or if a person experiences inflammation in the body.

Albumin increases when a person is dehydrated.
