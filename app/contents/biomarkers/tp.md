The total protein test is a rough measure of all of the proteins in the plasma portion of your blood. Proteins are important building blocks of all cells and tissues. 

Total protein measures the combined amount of proteins the two major two classes of which are albumin and immunoglobulin. Albumin is a carrier of many small molecules, but its main purpose is to keep fluid from leaking out of blood vessels, while immunoglobulin proteins are antibodies. 

To a much lesser extent enzymes and more than 500 other proteins contribute to the total protein.
