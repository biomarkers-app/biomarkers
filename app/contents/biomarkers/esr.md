ESR is an indirect measure of the degree of inflammation present in the body. It actually measures the rate of fall (sedimentation) of erythrocytes (red blood cells) in a tall, thin tube of blood.

Results are reported as how many millimetres of clear plasma are present at the top of the column after one hour.

Normally, red cells fall slowly, leaving little clear plasma. Increased blood levels of certain proteins (such as fibrinogen or immunoglobulins, which are increased in inflammation) cause the red blood cells to fall more rapidly, increasing the ESR.

Doctors do not base their decisions solely on ESR results. You can have a normal result and still have a problem.

A very high ESR usually has an obvious cause, such as an infection. The doctor will use other follow-up tests, such as cultures, depending on the patient’s symptoms.
