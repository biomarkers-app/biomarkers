Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell (WBC or granulocyte) that protect us from infections, among other functions. They make up approximately 40% to 60% of the white blood cells in our bodies,1 and are the first cells to arrive on the scene when we experience a bacterial infection. A normal (absolute) neutrophil count is between 2500 and 6000 neutrophils per microliter of blood.2

The neutrophil count may be high with infections, due to increased production in the bone marrow as with leukemia, or due to physical or emotional stress. A low number of neutrophils may also be a sign of disease in conditions such as leukemia, some infections, vitamin B12 deficiency, chemotherapy, and more.
