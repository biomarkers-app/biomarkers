ALT is an enzyme found mostly in the liver; smaller amounts are also found in the kidneys, heart, and muscles. When the liver is damaged, ALT is released into the bloodstream, hence increasing the concentration that can be detected in a blood test. This often happens before more obvious symptoms of liver damage occur, such as jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin).

The ALT blood test detects liver injury. ALT results are usually assessed alongside the results of other blood tests such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), to help determine which form of liver disease is present.
