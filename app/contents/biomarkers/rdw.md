A red cell distribution width (RDW) test is a measurement of the range in the volume and size of your red blood cells (erythrocytes). Red blood cells move oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and stay healthy. If your red blood cells are larger than normal, it could indicate a medical problem.

The RDW blood test is often part of a complete blood count (CBC), a test that measures many different components of your blood, including red cells. The RDW test is commonly used to diagnose anemia, a condition in which your red blood cells can't carry enough oxygen to the rest of your body.
