Nucleated red blood cells are immature red blood cells. In adults, their presence in the blood indicates a problem.

As red blood cells mature, they lose their nucleus – a part of the cell where DNA is stored. This enables them to carry more hemoglobin (and therefore more oxygen) and become highly flexible in shape.

Nucleated RBCs (NRBCs, normoblasts) are immature red blood cells (RBCs) that still contain a nucleus. Unlike the mature ones, nucleated red blood cells are unable to “squeeze” through portholes in the bone marrow and enter the circulation.

In healthy adults and children, NRBCs are usually only found in the bone marrow where they develop and mature. Their presence in the blood signifies the disruption of the blood-bone marrow barrier or increased red blood cell production outside the bone marrow.

However, NRBCs are common in the blood of fetuses and newborn babies, especially if they are experiencing growth retardation or a lack of oxygen.
