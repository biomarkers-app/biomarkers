Some of the glucose in your blood binds to haemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in your red blood cells). This combination of glucose and haemoglobin is called haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

The amount of HbA1c formed is directly related to the average concentration of glucose in your bloodstream. Red blood cells live for 2â€“3 months, and because of this, the amount of HbA1c in your blood reflects the average level of glucose in your blood during the last 2-3 months.

If your diabetes is not well controlled, your blood glucose levels will be high causing higher HbA1c levels.
