Iron tests measure different substances in the blood to check iron levels in your body. Iron is a mineral that's essential for making red blood cells.

Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Iron is also important for healthy muscles, bone marrow, and organ function. Iron levels that are too low or too high can cause serious health problems.
