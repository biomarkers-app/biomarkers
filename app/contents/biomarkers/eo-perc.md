Eosinophils are a kind of white blood cell that helps fight disease. The exact role of eosinophils in your body isn't clear, but they're usually linked with allergic diseases and certain infections. They're made in your bone marrow and then travel to different tissues.

Eosinophils do two important things in your immune system: curb infections and boost inflammation, which can help you fight off a disease.

Eosinophilia is when you have a higher than normal number of these special cells in your blood or tissue.

If you take a blood test and the results arenâ€™t in the normal range, your doctor may recommend more tests to figure out the problem. If this happens on a test called a white blood cell differential, you may need to get another blood test called an absolute eosinophil count. You might also get this test if your doctor thinks you have a particular kind of disease.
