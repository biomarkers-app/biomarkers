Triglycerides are the main type of fat found in the blood. Excess food that you don't use right away is stored in the form of triglycerides. 

Too high a level of triglycerides can raise your risk for heart disease and stroke. While <150mg/dL is considered normal, many recommend a triglycerides goal of <100mg/dL. 

Since triglycerides contribute to atherosclerosis, it is important to have the proper balance of triglycerides with artery-clearing HDL cholesterol. 

The ideal ratio of Triglycerides to HDL cholesterol is less than 2:1, while a ratio greater than 6:1 is considered very high risk. By lowering your triglycerides and this ratio, you can decrease your risk of cardiovascular disease, such as a heart attack and stroke.
