Beta globulins are a group of globular blood proteins that can be measured by electrophoresis; among the molecules belonging to this category we remember for example

- beta-2 microglobulin,
- plasminogen,
- angiostatins,
- properdin,
- sex hormone binding globulin,
- transferrin.

From a very general point of view, beta globulins increase in concentration in the case of inflammation.

The interpretation of the exam is always conducted in the specific context, in particular linked to the reasons that led to the request for the exam, because the conditions capable of causing variations from normal values ​​are numerous and varied.

From a very general point of view, the beta fraction is mainly made up of transferrin, therefore it is common to find a high value in case of iron deficiency, but among the other possible causes of increase are also included, for example, high cholesterol and multiple myeloma .

A lower than normal value is instead often connected to a condition of malnutrition or liver cirrhosis.
