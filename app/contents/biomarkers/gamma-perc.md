Immunoglobulins are molecules that are part of the gamma-globulins, which in turn belong to the large family of globulins, one of the two groups of plasma proteins.

Gamma-globulins are molecules at the service of the immune system, more in detail they are proteins capable of neutralizing pathogens such as bacteria and viruses; they are produced by some white blood cells (B lymphocytes) in response to stimulation triggered by external insults.

Better known as antibodies or simply Ig, they mainly include:

- IgA,
- IgG,
- IgM
- and to a lesser extent, IgD and IgE.

Together with albumin, alpha and beta globulins, they represent the main plasma proteins of the organism: in order to be identified individually, they must be separated in the laboratory, using a procedure called electrophoresis, which allows the different proteins to be divided according to their mobility within an electric field.

An increase in gamma globulin values generally indicates inflammation and an underlying disease. The different types of immunoglobulins can increase together at the same time or, in other cases, the increase of a single antibody is recorded.
