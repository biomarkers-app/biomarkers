Not all cholesterol increases your risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. HDL cholesterol, the healthier cholesterol, helps carry
artery-clogging substances away from your blood vessels and back to your liver to get metabolized. The Total Cholesterol/HDL Cholesterol ratio
assesses what portion of all of your cholesterol is healthy and unhealthy cholesterol. A higher ratio means more cholesterol is unhealthy
artery-clogging LDL cholesterol, while a lower ratio means more is your good HDL cholesterol. By lowering your ratio, you can decrease your risk of
cardiovascular disease.
