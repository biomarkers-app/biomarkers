About Apo B

Apolipoprotein B, or Apo B, is the protein in bad LDL cholesterol that helps these particles bind to and clog blood vessels. Because ApoB increases
this clogging, your ApoB level may be a better measure of cardiovascular risk than even LDL cholesterol. High levels of ApoB increases your risk of
cardiovascular disease, and by lowering your ApoB, you can reduce your risk for a heart attack and stroke. Note: We have recently adjusted our risk
range to be more consistent with most national laboratories, though some labs recommend ApoB to be less than 60.
