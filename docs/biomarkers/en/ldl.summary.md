LDL,which stands for low-density lipoprotein, is considered the less helpful type of cholesterol because it can transport cholesterol to the walls of arteries, forming clogging plaques that put you at risk for heart disease and stroke. Specifically, greater numbers of small dense LDL particles increase this risk as compared to lesser numbers of large less dense particles. By lowering your LDL cholesterol, you can decrease your risk of cardiovascular disease.
