NULLHDL, or high-density lipoprotein, or "good" cholesterol, is the one type of cholesterol that is helpful. HDL cholesterol acts as a "scavenger" of
excess cholesterol, bringing extra cholesterol from arteries and the body back to the liver to be metabolized. This means that higher levels of HDL
cholesterol are actually better. HDL cholesterol greater than 60 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) can help protect you against heart disease, with
higher levels even more protective.
