While we all need some cholesterol to make sure our bodies stay healthy and function correctly, too much bad (LDL) cholesterol can be dangerous, and increases the risk for heart disease and stroke, otherwise known as cardiovascular disease. LDL Cholesterol can be deposited in arteries and clog them, obstructing the transport of oxygen-rich blood, essential for a healthy and functioning heart and brain. A simple way to understand if you have the proper amount of good cholesterol, the ideal Total Cholesterol to HDL Cholesterol ratio is less than 3.5:1. If your ratio is greater than 5:1, this is considered very high-risk.
